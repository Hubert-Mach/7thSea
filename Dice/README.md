# Let it ROLL!

While all dice provide a decent probability each type move differently across the table.

D4 - what comes up, comes up

D6 - roll

D8 - what comes up, comes up

D10 - spin

D12 - roll

D20 - roll

I'm most amused when dice roll, so here is a table providing probability on dice that rolls with no need for designing new exotic dice shapes.

All that needs to be done is to simply place same numbers on multiple dice faces. It might sound strange, but math is correct.

To get 1:10 probability od D20 dice just put each number twice.

Formula is: number of faces / probability = times numbers needs to be repeated.

| Probability | Dice |
| -------- | -------- |
| 1:2 | D6/D12/D20 |
| 1:3 | D6/D12 |
| 1:4 | D12/D20 |
| 1:5 | D20 |
| 1:6 | D6/D12 |
| 1:10 | D20 |
| 1:12 | D12 |
| 1:20 | D20 |
